          Welcome to the official website of the multidisciplinary research
          group on Food, Oxidative Stress and Cardiovascular Health (FOSCH)!
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          FOSCH is part of the scientific teams of the Universidad Aut칩noma de
          Madrid (UAM, Spain). The fundamental mission is to study the
          properties and bioactive compounds of foods in relation to the
          promotion and well-being of cardiovascular health, as well as the
          development of new food products through sustainable ecology and to
          explore the role of the oxidative status in modulating cardiovascular
          disease.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          FOSCH is led by Dr. Silvia M. Arribas, Physiologist of the Faculty of
          Medicine and Dr. Maria A. Martin, Bromatologist of the Faculty of
          Sciences of the UAM.
